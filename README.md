# Snake Game w/ Python

## This game was built with using topics such as class inheritence, instances, event listeners and more

This project was a great experience on learning how to use other classes within my own project while also being able to modify and add my own touch.

I would like to add my own twist and create a game similar to this one, once I have more practice.

### STAY TUNED!!!
